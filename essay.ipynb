    "The growth of user-generated content in web sites and social networks, just to mention a few: Yelp, Twitter, Amazon, Tripadvisor, Rottentomatoes and IMDB has led to an increasing power for expressing opinions. In recent years, the automatic extraction of opinions from a text has become an area of growing interest in Natural Language Processing (NLP). Online opinions have turned into a valuable asset since the fast spreading nature of online content. In order to analyze the massive amount of data, many NLP tasks are being used. In particular, Sentiment Analysis, also known as Opinion Mining (from now on: SA), became an increasingly growing task, whose goal it is to classify opinions and sentiments expressed in user-generated text. SA is on the rise due to the increased requirement of analyzing and structuring hidden information, which comes from user-generated content in the form of unstructured data (Ain, Ali, Riaz, Noureen, Kamran, Hayat & Rehman, 2017). It allows to detect the emotion and sentiment that an author of a text felt towards a described subject or entity. It is interesting in many fields and branches and helps solving various tasks, e.g.:\n",
    "\n",
    "- companies are able to measure the feedback about a product or service,\n",
    "- sociologists can look at people’s reaction about certain public events,\n",
    "- psychologists can study the general mind state of communities with regard to various issues, i.e. a depression detection model that is based on SA in micro-blog social networks (Wang, Zhang, Ji, Sun, Wu & Bao, 2013),\n",
    "- governments and political parties are able to correct their actions according to social approval or disapproval,\n",
    "- etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "The challenge is that sentiments are not always expressed explicitly and meanings can be hidden in the context. In these cases, additional word and language knowledge is necessary. Moreover, opinions may involve sarcasm and negations, which can be interpreted differently in various domains and contexts. Sentiment classification is rather easy for humans (Pang, Lee & Vaithyanathan, 2002), but manual review and analysis of texts is very time consuming and expensive. Due to this fact, automatic sentiment classifiers are selected instead. "

    "#### Sentiment Analysis: Definition, Application & Classification \n",
    "\n",
    "Sentiment Analysis is an active research area in NLP that refers to the use of text analysis, statistical learning and often Machine Learning to extract subjective information in source materials such as user-generated texts from social networks, blogs, forums and product or service reviews.\n",
    "Selecting the basic emotions is a difficult task for a computer because of the variety of human emotions. Most of the authors in the NLP community agree on the classification proposed by Ekman, Friesen and Ellsworth (1982) that six basic emotions exist: anger, disgust, fear, joy, sadness and surprise. As such a division requires a complex processing and analysis of the input data, the majority of researchers and authors accept a simpler representation of sentiments according to their polarity (Pang & Lee, 2008). Kurosu (2015) defines sentiment polarity as follows: “The polarity of a sentiment is the point on the evaluation scale that corresponds to our positive or negative evaluation of the meaning of this sentiment.”. Sentiment polarity allows researchers to use a binary or ternary measurement, either positive, negative or neutral and therefore, simplifies the representation and management of the sentiment information. The granularity of SA can be either coarse-grained or fine-grained. Coarse-grained means usually a binary classification (positive, negative). On ther other hand, fine-grained uses for example five possible levels of granularity (high positive, low positive, neutral, low negative, high negative). Liu et al. (2015) presented three levels of SA: document level, sentence level and entity / aspect level. \n",
    "\n",
    "While document level studies the polarity of the whole text with respect to a single entity (e.g. a product), sentence level studies the polarity of single sentences, analyzing clauses and phrases for its sentiment. Contrary, entity / aspect level analyzes what people especially liked or disliked. An entity-aspect might be a single token and its polarity might be different from the overall polarity of the text (Liu et al., 2015).\n",
    "\n",
    "#####  Application\n",
    "To mention a few application areas:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Social media monitoring,\n",
    "- Customer support / feedback,\n",
    "- Brand monitoring and reputation management,\n",
    "- Voice of customer (VoC),\n",
    "- Voice of employee,\n",
    "- Product analysis,\n",
    "- Market research and competitive research.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Classification\n",
    "\n",
    "All methods used to solve sentiment classification fall into three main categories: lexicon-based, machine learning-based and hybrid approaches.\n",
    "\n",
    "In lexicon-based approaches, also known as knowledge-based methods, sentiment is seen as a function of keywords and is based on their count. The main task is the construction of sentiment word lexicons with the indicated class labels positive or negative. In some cases also with their intensiveness, which becomes important for a fine-grained classification.\n",
    "\n",
    "An alternative to the knowledge-based method is Machine Learning (ML), which is gaining more and more interest of researchers due to its adaptability and higher accuracy. Traditional Machine Learning methods were the dominant approach in SA (Pang et al., 2002) with the three main algorithms: Naïve Bayes (NB), Support Vector Machines (SVM) and Maximum Entropy (MaxEnt, in Statistics called: Logisitic Regression). Part of Machine Learning models are Deep Learning models (DL) and Transformer models.\n",
    "\n",
    "DL is an area of ML research that attempts to learn in multiple levels, corresponding to different levels of abstraction. Traditional ML relies on non-deep nets: composed of one input layer, one output layer and maximum one hidden layer inbetween. More than three layers (including input and output layer) qualifiy a net as “deep”.\n",
    "\n",
    "A Transformer is a type of neural network architecture developed by Vaswani et al. (2017). This model architecture consists of a multi-head self-attention mechanism combined with an encoder-decoder structure. Now in a bit more detail, transformers work like this: first, the input embedding is multi-dimensional in the sense that it can process complete sentences and not a series of words one by one. Second, it has a powerful multi-headed attention mechanism that enables sentences to maintain context and relationships between words within a sentence. This attention analysis gets performed for each word several times to ensure adequate sampling. Lastly, it uses a feed forward neural network to normalize the results and provide a sentiment prediction. To learn more about the architecture of transformer models be sure to visit the the transformers library provided by Hugging Face [huggingface website](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/index) as this library gives you access to more than 32 pre-trained state-of-the-art (SOTA) models.\n",
    "\n",
    "The hybrid approach, also known as combined analysis or ensemble model, combines both knowledge-based and Machine Learning-based methods and thus, can lead to a superior performance. Researchers were attracted to explore the hybrid approach that collectively could exhibit the accuracy of a ML approach and the speed of a lexical approach."

    "\n",
    "Last but not least, we also studied a few papers in the literature about the latest trend and state-of-the-art: Transformer models (Bacco, L., Cimino, A., Dell’Orletta, F., & Merone, M. (2021); Jiang, M., Wu, J., Shi, X., & Zhang, M. (2019); Wu, Z., Ying, C., Dai, X., Huang, S., & Chen, J. (2020))."

    "This experiment used the popular and simple ML algorithm Logistic Regression as a baseline algorithm. Logistic Regression is a statistical technique capable of predicting a binary outcome. Using the built-in functions of scikit-learn, the Logistic Regression was very easy to build. After loading the respective dataset, the code had to re-create all the words from the pre- processed data set to build an index, which translates all lists of word-indices to strings and then used Term Frequence - Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) as text representation. TF-IDF is a statistical measure used to evaluate how important a word is in a document. First, it computes the Term Frequence (TF) for each review, the Inverse Document Frequency (IDF) using each review and finally, the TF-IDF for each review. It transforms on the Test data which computes the TF for each review, then the TF-IDF for each review using the IDF from the Training data. Finally, the model was fit to classify the sentiment of the movie reviews.\n"

    "As Long Short Term Memory networks (LSTM) are the most often used DL models for sentiment analysis (Ligthart et. al., 2021), we decided to test them in our experiment. Our vanilla LSTM architecture consists of an embedding, LSTM, and a fully connected layer. In between we use two dropout layers to prevent overfitting.\n",
    "We found the blog of Christopher Olah particulary helpful and suggest to check it out for gaining a first understanding of how LSTMs work: https://colah.github.io/posts/2015-08-Understanding-LSTMs/\n",
    "\n",
    "According to the findings of Ligthart et al. (2021), convolutional neural networks (CNN) are the second most often used DL models for sentiment analysis. Recent research also indicates that a hybrid CNN & LSTM model can outperform traditional ML algorithms on sentiment analysis tasks (e.g. Jain et al.,2021, Yadav & Vishwakarma, 2020). Our proposed architecture consists of an embedding layer, a convolution layer which receives the input from the embedding layer, a pooling layer, the ouput of which is fed into the LSTM layer, two fully connected, as well as dropout layers.\n",
    "\n",
    "We tokenize and pad the data using Keras built-in functions in order to bring all reviews/ tweets in the suitable format. Embedding layer is necessary for dimensionality reduction which is achieved by converting each word into a vector of defined length. Similar words have similar embeddings. We try out 2 approaches: training embeddings from scratch on the vocabularies from our respective datasets and using pre-trained embeddings (transfer learning). We use GloVe (Global Vectors for Word Representation) embeddings from Stanford researchers (Pennington et al., 2014) trained on 1) Wikipedia texts and 2) Tweets."

    "As it was the case with our baseline model, both LSTM and CNN-LSTM models perform better when applied to the raw data. Our CNN-LSTM model, however, didn't outperform neither the baseline nor the LSTM model. The latter model does give better accuracy compared to the logistic regression, but even for the highest results the improvement over the baseline model is marginal (1.11% for IMDB and 0.74% for Sentiment140 dataset).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Below you can find an overview of the results for both datasets. While presenting a bunch of results from running the models with slightly different parameters usually doesn't belong to the best practices of machine learning, we do it on purpose to illustrate the effect of changing the embeddings, their dimensions, and epochs. \n",
    "\n",
    "We found out that pretrained embeddings had a slight positive effect on the models' performance. This is consistent with our reviewed literature. As expected, LSTM with GloVe embeddings which were trained on Wikipedia & Gigaword texts performed better than LSTM with embeddings trained on tweets. The opposite was true for the Sentiment140 dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can also observe a trend where increased dimensionality of the embeddings leads to slight improvements in the models' accuracy. This is most visible for the pretrained embeddings while the results for embeddings which were trained from scratch are not so straightforward.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, increasing the number of epochs for the LSTM model with pretrained embeddings also provides us with small accuracy gains. Interestingly, this is not the case with the embeddings trained from scratch. Here our results for both datasets usually got worse with increased number of epochs.\n",

This made us think that our preprocessing might have been ripping off parts of the information of the texts and might have led to wrong predictions. Another thought is that the more complex the sentences and more irony / sarcasm are „hidden“ in the texts, the more DL models are the better approach in comparison to traditional ML models. Unfortunately with scarce time at the end of the semester, we couldn’t look deeper into that topic but would recommend this as a topic for further research."

    "- preprocessing might be tricky\n",
    "\n",
    "Consistent with the current state of the art, our LSTM model performed better than the baseline logistic regression model, and DistilBert provides the best results on the sentiment classification task. This, however, requires additional time/ computational resources. The appropriatness of apllication of complex models would depend on the specific use cases. In a lot of real-world business applications marginal accuracy improvements might not justify increases in computational ressources. This is especially true if classifications are made on a frequent basis. At the same time, the training, of course, doesn't necessarily need to be done each time before the classification. It might be feasible to make an investment, train the transformer model once, save it and reuse.\n",
    "\n",
    "As for the classroom setting, the choice of the appropriate model would strongly depend on the available computational ressources and the overall application setting. If the goal is to explore/ improve the state-of-the-art, transformers are surely the best choice. Due to time constraints we weren't able to explore all possible fine-tuning opportunities for our DistilBert model and, nevertheless, did get good results. Therefore, it would be intersting to explore whether further fine-tuning of the model (including the preprocessing of the respective data) can result in better performance and results.\n"
